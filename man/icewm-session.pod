=head2 NAME

 icewm-session - X.Org session manager provider with IceWM

=head2 SYNOPSIS

B<icewm-session> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head2 DESCRIPTION

icewm-session is an implementation of a X.Org session manager and can be
run from a X11 session setup. It runs B<icewm> as default window manager
and controls the life cycle of related support applications.

=head2 OPTIONS

=head2 SPECIFIC OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-c>, B<--config=FILE>

Let IceWM load preferences from I<FILE>.

=item B<-t>, B<--theme=FILE>

Let IceWM load the theme I<FILE>.

=item B<-i>, B<--icewm=FILE>

Use I<FILE> as the IceWM window manager.

=item B<-o>, B<--output=FILE>

Redirect all output to I<FILE>.
A leading tilde or environment variable is expanded.

=item B<-a>, B<--alpha>

Use a 32-bit visual for translucency.

=item B<-b>, B<--nobg>

Do not start icewmbg.

=item B<-n>, B<--notray>

Do not start icewmtray.
This is only applicable if IceWM was explicitly configured
to use an external icewmtray process.

=item B<-s>, B<--sound>

Also start icesound.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-d>, B<--display>=I<DISPLAY>

Use I<DISPLAY> to connect to the X server.
If this option is missing then I<DISPLAY>
is read from the environment variable C<DISPLAY>.

=item B<--sync>

Use a slower synchronous mode communication with the I<X11> server.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Give a list of all supported options and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions and exit.

=back

=head2 DEBUGGING OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-v>, B<---valgrind>

Let C</usr/bin/valgrind> run icewm.
Thoroughly examines the execution of icewm.

=item B<-g>, B<---catchsegv>

Let C</usr/bin/catchsegv> run icewm.
Gives a backtrace if icewm segfaults.

=back

=head2 USAGE

On startup icewm-session executes the following steps.
From the file F<env> in the configuration directory
it loads additional environment variables, if that file exists.
Then it will start F<icewmbg> to manage root background colors and images.
It may also start F<icesound>, if this was enabled at configuration time.
Then F<icewm> is started.

If there exists an executable script F<startup> in the configuration
directory, it will be executed. It may contain commands to initialize X11
settings with F<xset>, load keyboard configuration, start a compositing
manager like F<compton> and load system tray applications.

When icewm exits, icewm-session will execute a F<shutdown> script,
if it exists in the configuration directory.
When this finishes, icewm-session will terminate icewm, icewmbg
and icesound. Finally, icewm-session will exit.

If the icewm process crashes then icewm-session will attempt to restart
it. If two such crashes occur in a short period, then icewm-session will
attempt to popup a dialog using either F<yad>, F<xmessage>, F<kdialog>
or F<zenity>.  This dialog presents a choice between restarting icewm,
starting a terminal, or abort execution of icewm-session.

=head2 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item B<ICEWM_OPTIONS>

A space separated list of options which will be added to the command
line invocation of F<icewm>. This can be set in the F<env> file.
